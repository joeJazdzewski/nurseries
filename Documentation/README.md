This project is for me to better understand the nursery model and the trio python library by implementing it in C#. I also wanted to try out my documentation and design method that is based on [Kotlin Evolution and Enhancement Process or Keep](https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP). 


Where design changes are done in pull requests and that can be reviewed as well as checked before code is submitted. the design of the project should be update with the code is submitted so that design and documentation will be up to date for that version. this will lead to Version N having Version N design docs.
